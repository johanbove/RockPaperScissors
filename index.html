		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<em>I keep on losing my scores when I close the page!</em>
				<br />
				Warning: scores are unfortunately lost when you refresh the page. Next version will use <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html">HTML5 local storage</a> to keep track of your score.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>I am tired of playing against a machine! Can I play this with my friends?</em>
				<br />
				Playing against your friends is planned and I'll probably implement this using HTML5 websockets, eg. <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a>, and I'm thinking of a multi-player version as well.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>I don't speak English!</em>
				<br />
				A multi-lingual version is planned using some nifty <em>i18n</em> implementation!
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>It looks bad and boring!</em>
				<br />
				Yeah, you're totally right! The plan is to design something prettier to look at as well. Currently using the JS alert boxes seems a little too old-skool. Thinking of applying <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone.js</a> for exactly that purpose!
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>This is too easy! What about a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard version?</em>
				<br />
				Awesome idea! I'm on it, but it'll have to be a different game though... hmm, let me think about it.
